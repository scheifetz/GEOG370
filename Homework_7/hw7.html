<h1>Homework 7 </h1>
<h2>Sara Cheifetz</h2>
<h3> I am studying geology so I wanted to use the USGS website for my data. There, I found a data set for all Earthquakes within a 24 hour period, and created a map of those in the U.S. during the period which went from around 5pm on October 17 to around 5pm on October 18.</h3>

<!-- Link to your shapefile in Github and you CSV -->
<h2>Data used for this project</h2>
    <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php"> USGS website </a>
    <p> I downloaded the CSV of all the Earthquakes within the 24 hour period from 10/17-10/18. From there, I cleaned the data by removing data that wasn't needed for my map, like the magnitude of each earthquake. I tallied the total number of earthquakes for each state, and used this data to make my chloropleth.  </p>
